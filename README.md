# Cyberpunk_surfers
Created using the Pygame library, Cyberpunk Surfers is my interpretation of a 2D cyberpunk version of the popular subway surfers game. Watch gameplay.mp4 to see how to play.

Program: main.py

How to play: Press spacebar to jump to avoid getting hit by the trains and score points by collecting gems.

Disclaimer: All the assets that were used are free online and have been edited to fit the style of the game.

Cautionary note: The audio is very loud.
